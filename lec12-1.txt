introduction to pointers

each element requires memory 
& operator
float b;
"ADDRESS" of the element 
when you know the address of the elemets of an element 
you can find the element 


what is pointer?
 first of all, it is a variable , just like other variables you studied so it has type, storage
difference:it can only store the address(rather than the value) of a data item 
type of a pointer variables- pointer to the type of the data whose address it will store 
Example: int pointer, float pointer 
can be pointer to any user-defined types also like 
structure types
